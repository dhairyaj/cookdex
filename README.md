# Getting Started with CookDex

CookDex is a react application which used Spoonacular Api to fetch recipies and displays their ingredients and instructions to prepare. You can search for a recipe, fetch a specific cuisine (Italian, Thai, American, Japanese) or select from our handpicked popular and vegetarian choices.

To start the project in your system : 
- Clone the repository
- Run npm install
- Head over to <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a> website and get your key.
- Create a .env file and add your key to the variable REACT_APP_API_KEY
- Run npm start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
